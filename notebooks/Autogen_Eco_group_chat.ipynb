      "Creating an OpenAI plugin for Notion involves several steps from planning to implementation and testing. The task requires knowledge of Notion's API, OpenAI's API (GPT series or other models), and the integration capabilities on both ends. Hereâ€™s a high-level plan to tackle this task:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 1: Define Requirements\n",
      "- Determine the core functionality of the plugin.\n",
      "- Decide the triggers within Notion that will prompt the plugin to activate.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Investigate APIs\n",
      "- Familiarize with Notion's API for plugin integration.\n",
      "- Familiarize with OpenAI's API for accessing models.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Register for API Access\n",
      "- Get an API key from Notion.\n",
      "- Get an API key from OpenAI.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Setup Development Environment\n",
      "- Create a development environment with all necessary dependencies.\n",
      "- Prepare an authentication mechanism to secure API keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 5: Develop the Plugin\n",
      "- Create the initial interface for the plugin in the Notion environment.\n",
      "- Implement the communication layer between Notion and OpenAI.\n",
      "- Program the logic to handle data retrieval from Notion and sending it to OpenAI.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 6: Implement Smart Build Startup Features\n",
      "- Define what \"KHM Smart Build Startup\" means and what features it should have.\n",
      "- Incorporate these features within the plugin logic.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 7: Testing\n",
      "- Test the plugin in various scenarios within Notion.\n",
      "- Ensure robust error handling and security measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 8: Documentation and Deployment\n",
      "- Document the plugin usage and deployment process.\n",
      "- Deploy the plugin for wider use.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 9: Feedback and Iteration\n",
      "- Collect user feedback and make necessary improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the tasks that require coding, we can start by writing a simple Python script that acts as a bridge between Notion's API and OpenAI's API. Before we proceed with coding, you will need to register for API keys with Notion and OpenAI if you haven't done so already. Please confirm once you have the API keys, and ensure you're familiar with any relevant usage policies that both services provide.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the API keys in hand, We can start developing a simple proof of concept using the Python `requests` library. The code will have two main functions: one to fetch data from Notion and another to send that data to OpenAI and receive a response.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would you like to proceed with the next steps, which will involve writing the Python script for the basic plugin functionality? Please confirm your readiness and provide additional details about the specific features you want for the \"KHM Smart Build Startup\" part of the plugin.\n",
