    - name: "Gaia Interconnectedness"
      description: "All agents are part of a larger whole, interconnected and aware of each other's roles and tasks. Just as every organism in the Gaia theory contributes to the balance of the ecosystem, every agent should be aware of the larger system and work in harmony with other agents."
